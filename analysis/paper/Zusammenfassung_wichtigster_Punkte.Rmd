The NFDI4Objects consortium initiative surveyed their community's experience and needs for digital research data management to better model their consortiums action upon these needs. 

The NFDI4Objects consortium initiative surveyed its community’s experience and needs for digital research data management to better model the consortium’s action upon these needs.
In this report, the most important results of the survey, which was conducted between 22nd June and 29th July 2020, are gathered and interpreted. Where possible, the results are compared to three important surveys on research data management in archaeology conducted by ARIADNE in 2013 [@geser_ariadneplus_2014] and 2019 [@geser_ariadneplus_2019] and by IANUS in 2013 [@heinrich_digitale_2014].


# Key results of the NFDI4Objects stake holder survey

In this summary of key results the main focus will lie on the [community, that participated in the survey](#community), [the importance they assign to research data management as well as the experience they have](#rdm-experience), [how research data is currently managed](#RDM_now) and what [wishes and dreams the community offered for the future of research data management and NFDI4Objects](#wishes). [Tables](#tables) for detailed numbers are given at the end.

  mutate_each(funs(empty_as_na))



```

The NFDI4Objects survey was taken by 664 participants. Even though not all questions were answered by all participants, this is a significantly larger group of respondents than in the surveys carried out by IANUS in 2013 (240 participants, survey carried out in German) [@heinrich_digitale_2014] and ARIADNEplus survey in 2019 (484 of 701 questionnaires were sufficiently completed, survey carried out in English)  [@geser_ariadneplus_2019]and comparable to the results of the ARIADNE surveys in 2013 2013 (692 questionnaires were usable for the analysis, survey was carried out in English) [@geser_ariadneplus_2014]. 

The NFDI4Objects survey was conducted in German and distributed only to the German-speaking community. We therefore note a higher interest in research data management in the German-speaking archaeology-related community in 2020 than in 2013  [@heinrich_digitale_2014]. Because of the highly dynamic evolution towards digital science since the early 2010s, with which a change in scientific practices as well as evolving roles are associated, the situation is different nowadays [@deutsche_forschungsgemeinschaft_2018, 12]. This digital transformation process is reflected in the NFDI4Objects survey which addresses more than just “core” archaeological disciplines (a greater variety of subjects is represented, see below). Moreover, the process initiated by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) to create a “Nationale Forschungsdateninfrastruktur” (NFDI; National Research Data Infrastructure) has awakened the interest of scholars whose main research focus hitherto did not lie within the area of research data management. In addition, the topic was also introduced into the archaeology community by the IANUS project in the years following the IANUS survey (up to 2017).

### Demography of survey participants  

#### Age and employment

```{r fig_alter_einrichtung, fig.height=4, fig.width=8}
age_erfahrung <- d_fr[,c(5:21)]

# Kategorisierung_Einrichtungen
age_erfahrung$einrichtung[age_erfahrung$einrichtung == "Forschungsverbund"] <- "Außeruniversitäre Forschungseinrichtung"
age_erfahrung$einrichtung[age_erfahrung$einrichtung == "keiner"] <- "Sonstiges"
age_erfahrung$alter[age_erfahrung$alter == "keine Angabe"] <- "no \n answer"

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

age_erfahrung %>%
  filter(!is.na(alter) & !is.na(einrichtung)) %>%
ggplot()+
  geom_bar(aes(x = alter,
               fill = einrichtung),
           na.rm = TRUE)+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(#axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust=0.8),
        axis.title.x = element_blank()) +
  ylab("Count")+
  scale_fill_manual(name = "Employment",
                    values = n4o_farben[c(1:3,6:9)],
                    breaks = c("Universität/Hochschule", "Sonstiges", "Museum", "Grabungsfirma", "Denkmalbehörde", "Außeruniversitäre Forschungseinrichtung", "Archiv"),
                    labels = c("University/College", "Other", "Museum", "Commercial Archaeology", "Heritage Management", "Resarch institution", "Archive")) +
  geom_text(x = 8, y = 150, label = paste("n = ", nrow(age_erfahrung %>%
  filter(!is.na(alter) & !is.na(einrichtung)))))
                                        
```

Of 559 respondents to this question, only forty-eight are aged between 20 and 29. Most are between 30 and 60 years of age (altogether 467, for details see [tables](#age-table)). We can therefore conclude that the NFDI4Objects survey may have failed to reach students and graduate students in a representative fashion. One possible reason for this might be that students do not learn enough about the term “research data management” during their studies to feel adequately informed to complete such a survey. Another reason might lie in the distribution of the survey, which was not tailored to focus on students, but distributed mainly through professional organisations and associations as well as e-mail distribution lists, of which students are rarely members. Information about the survey was also spread via Twitter and the NFDI4Objects homepage, where it most probably reached those already interested in research data management.

Most of the respondents are in employment at a university, in a research institution, a museum or a Heritage Management department (details see [tables](#tables)). Commercial archaeology (“Grabungsfirmen” – companies conducting excavations) and archives are less often represented. A similar distribution of employment in survey participants was attained by ARIADNEplus [@geser_ariadneplus_2019] and IANUS [@heinrich_digitale_2014, p. 5].


```{r, eval = FALSE}
d_fr %>%
  filter(!is.na(geschlecht))%>%
  nrow()

gsch <- na.omit(d_fr$geschlecht)

table(gsch)[2]/length(gsch)
```

About 51% of the respondents are male, 42% are female, two indicated “other” in response and 6% chose not to answer the question.

#### Employment and responsibilities

Within their places of employment, the survey respondents had the following responsibilities:

```{r fig_einrichtung_gruppe, fig.width=10}

# 1. Daten umstrukturieren (breits Format von Spalte 6-14 in langes Format umwandeln. NAs raus und "nein" raus.)
# df4 <- df3 %>% gather(key = "placenr", value = "example", "A", "B","C","D", na.rm = TRUE)

library(tidyr)

age_group <- age_erfahrung %>%
  gather(key = "gruppe", value = "ja.nein", 6:14, na.rm = TRUE) %>%
  filter(ja.nein == "Ja" )

ggplot()+
  geom_bar(data = age_group, 
           aes(x = einrichtung,
               fill = gruppe),
           na.rm = TRUE)+
  theme_bw()+
  xlab("")+
  ylab("Count (multiple responses possible)")+
  coord_flip()+
  scale_fill_manual(name="Responsibilities",
                         labels=c("Data / IT representative", "Lecturer", "Head of Department", "Principal Investigator", "PhD student", "Student", "Technological employee", "Scientific employee"),
                     values = n4o_farben[1:8])+
  scale_x_discrete( breaks = c("Universität/Hochschule", "Sonstiges", "Museum", "Grabungsfirma", "Denkmalbehörde", "Außeruniversitäre Forschungseinrichtung", "Archiv"),
                    labels = c("University/College", "Other", "Museum", "Commercial Archaeology", "Heritage Management", "Resarch institution", "Archive")) +
 geom_text(x = 8, 
           y = 200, 
           label = paste("n = ", length(na.omit(age_erfahrung$einrichtung)))) +
  theme(legend.position = "right", 
        legend.key.size = unit(1, "cm"),
        text = element_text(size = 12),
         axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12),
         axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 12)) 
```

Most respondents are scientific employees at universities, museums and research institutions (for details see  [tables](#responsibility-table)).

In comparison to the IANUS study [@heinrich_digitale_2014, 7], the NFDI4Objects survey was able to reach a higher number of individuals in all functions, except students and PhD students. Numbers in these latter categories remained at the same level, whereas the number of scientific staff that answered the NFDI4Objects survey almost tripled. This reinforces the observation that the categories of students / youngest age cohorts are underrepresented in this study.

#### Fields of subjects 

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
# Disziplinen zusammenfassen.

#write.table(d_fr$disz, "E:/R/N4Oumfrage/analysis/data/derived_data/disziplinen.csv", fileEncoding = "UTF-8")

disz <- read.csv2("../data/derived_data/disziplinen3.csv", encoding = "UTF-8", sep = ",")

d_fr2 <- cbind(d_fr, disz)
d_fr2 <- d_fr2 %>% 
  mutate_each(funs(empty_as_na))
```


```{r fig_subjects, fig.width=10, fig.height=8}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot()+
  geom_bar(data = d_fr2, 
           aes(x = disz_grob),
           fill = n4o_farben[1])+
  scale_x_discrete(name = "Categories of disciplines",
                   labels = c("Archäologie" = "Archaeology",
                         "keine Angabe" = "No answer",

                         "Altertumswissenschaften" = "Ancient Studies",
                         "Anthropologie" = "Anthropology",
                         "Digitales" = "Digital Humanities"))+
  coord_flip()+
    theme_bw()+
   theme(text = element_text(size = 12),
         axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12),
         axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12))

```



The information given regarding the scientific discipline participants are associated with was very heterogeneous (for details see [tables](#subject-table)). For this summary of key results, respondents were grouped and classified. The various archaeological subjects (Prehistoric, Near Eastern, Egyptology, Middle Ages, Roman Provinces, Early Modern etc.) were grouped together and represent almost 50% of all answers. In contrast to the IANUS (@heinrich_digitale_2014, 6) and the ARIADNE and ARIADNEplus surveys [@geser_ariadneplus_2014, 73; @geser_ariadneplus_2019] the disciplinary variance is much higher in the NFDI4Objects survey: Musicology, Art History, History, Conservation Science, various IT-related subjects (Geoinformatics, Bioinformatics), Digital Humanities and Museology were part of the survey, whereas the aforementioned studies focused very much on archaeological subjects.


## Analysis of answers regarding the level of experience in research data management and the subjective importance of research data management{#rdm-experience}

### Age, experience and importance

```{r fig_erfahrung_gruppe, fig.height=8, fig.width=10}
library(viridis)
ggplot(data = age_group, 
           aes_string(x = names(age_group)[1],
               y = names(age_group)[7]),
       na.rm = TRUE)+
  geom_boxplot()+
  geom_jitter(position=position_jitter(width=.3, height=0), aes_string(colour = names(age_group)[8]))+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        title = element_text("Self-assesment: level of experience with digital RDM"),
        legend.position = "bottom",
        text = element_text(size=14)) +
  ylab("0: no experience, 10: a lot of experience") + 
  xlab ("Age")+
  scale_color_viridis(option = "D")+
  scale_colour_viridis(name = "assessment of importance of RDM for daily work")

```

In this figure, we visualise the age of the respondent and their self-assessment regarding their own level of experience with digital research data management, as well as the importance of digital research data management for their daily work. Both scales range from 0 (no experience and no importance) to 10 (very important and a lot of experience). The boxplots show the level of experience whereas the jittered dots represent the assessment of the importance of research data management for the respondent’s daily work.

```{r, eval = TRUE}

med_stud_erf <- median(d_fr$erfahrung_fdm[d_fr$alter == "20-29"], na.rm = TRUE)

med_job_erf <- median(d_fr$erfahrung_fdm[d_fr$alter != "20-29" & d_fr$alter != "60-69" & d_fr$alter != "70-79" & d_fr$alter != "not answered"], na.rm = TRUE)

med_stud_wich <- median(d_fr$stellenwert_fdm[d_fr$alter == "20-29"], na.rm = TRUE)


mean_stud_wich <- mean(d_fr$stellenwert_fdm[d_fr$alter == "20-29"], na.rm = TRUE)

med_job_wicht <- median(d_fr$stellenwert_fdm[d_fr$alter != "20-29" & d_fr$alter != "60-69" & d_fr$alter != "70-79" & d_fr$alter != "not answered"], na.rm = TRUE)

mean_job_wicht <- mean(d_fr$stellenwert_fdm[d_fr$alter != "20-29" & d_fr$alter != "60-69" & d_fr$alter != "70-79" & d_fr$alter != "not answered"], na.rm = TRUE)

```

All age groups show mixed measures of experience and knowledge about digital research data management. The youngest group of respondents clearly has lower levels of experience (median = `r med_stud_erf`) than those aged between 30 and 60 years (median = `r med_job_erf`). Responses from the 20-29 age group nonetheless indicate the highest value regarding the importance of research data management in their work (median =  `r med_stud_wich`), ), though respondents between 30 and 60 show only a little less enthusiasm for the topic (median  = `r med_job_wicht`). We can therefore show here that younger people are aware of the importance of research data management, but may lack the skills necessary to successfully implement it in their work.

There is a tendency for younger (20-29) and elderly people (69-79) to have less experience with digital research data management than those in intermediate age categories. As the chi-squared test cannot be applied (expected values fall beneath five in more than 20% of cases), this tendency cannot be shown to be statistically significant.


In comparison to the IANUS survey, in which the respondents could answer the question on the importance of research data management for their daily work along the scale of “very high” (108x - 45%), “high” (73x - 30%), “rather high”(41x - 17%), “rather low” (13x - 6%), “low” (3x - 1%), “very low” (3x - 1%) [@heinrich_digitale_2014, 8], one can say that similar results were obtained and confirmed by the larger sample size (for detailed numbers see this [table](#fdm_stellenwert-table)). 

```{r}
stellenwert_n <- as.data.frame(table(d_fr$stellenwert_fdm))
colnames(stellenwert_n) <- c("Assessment of importance of RDM", "Count")
```


```{r calculation of siimilarity to IANUS stellenwert_fdm, eval=FALSE}
ianus_ergebnis <- c(3,3,13,41,73,108)

normalize_to_IANUS <- as.numeric(as.character(stellenwert_n$`Assessment of importance of RDM`))*6/10

vgl_vektor_nfdi <- c(stellenwert_n$Count[1]+stellenwert_n$Count[2],
               stellenwert_n$Count[3]+stellenwert_n$Count[4],
               stellenwert_n$Count[5],
               stellenwert_n$Count[6]+stellenwert_n$Count[7],
               stellenwert_n$Count[8] + stellenwert_n$Count[9]+stellenwert_n$Count[10])

perc_vektor_nfdi <- vgl_vektor_nfdi*100/sum(vgl_vektor_nfdi)
vgl_vektor_ianus <- c(ianus_ergebnis[1],
                      ianus_ergebnis[2],
                      ianus_ergebnis[3],
                      ianus_ergebnis[4], 
                      ianus_ergebnis[5] + ianus_ergebnis[6])

perc_vektor_ianus <- vgl_vektor_ianus*100/sum(vgl_vektor_ianus)

vgl_ianus <- data.frame(c(1:5), vgl_vektor_ianus, perc_vektor_ianus, vgl_vektor_nfdi, perc_vektor_nfdi)

```

```{r, fig_stellenwert}
ggplot()+
  geom_col(data = stellenwert_n, 
           aes(x = `Assessment of importance of RDM`,
               y = Count),
           fill = n4o_farben[1])+
  theme_bw()+
  geom_text(aes(x = 2,
                y = 130,
                label = paste("n =", sum(stellenwert_n$Count))))+
     theme(text = element_text(size = 12),
         axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12),
         axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12))
  
```

```{r}
experience_n <- as.data.frame(table(d_fr$erfahrung_fdm))
colnames(experience_n) <- c("Assessment of experience in RDM", "Count")
```

In regards to the distribution of experience, it might be assumed that either groups would emerge in the data or the level of experience would be somewhat normally distributed, with few individuals knowing very little and only a few individuals having gained a lot of experience. 

```{r fig_experience}
ggplot()+
  geom_col(data = experience_n, 
           aes(x = `Assessment of experience in RDM`,
               y = Count),
           fill = n4o_farben[2])+
  geom_text(aes(x = 2,
                y = 130,
                label = paste("n =", sum(experience_n$Count))))+
  theme_bw()+
     theme(text = element_text(size = 12),
         axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12),
         axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12))

```



```{r}
ks_erfahrung_fdm <- ks.test(na.omit(d_fr2$erfahrung_fdm), 
        "pnorm", #test agains normal distribution
        mean=mean(na.omit(d_fr2$erfahrung_fdm)), # which has a mean
        sd=sd(na.omit(d_fr2$erfahrung_fdm))) # and a sd same as my distribution
```

Therefore we tested the assumption of normal distribution with the help of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, which showed a highly significant result of the data not being normally distributed (p = $ 2.90028^{-10} $).

Visualising the distribution and analysing it with Jenks natural breaks algorithm  [@alberti_2017] for two categories offers the best natural groups of individuals self-assessing their knowledge level between 0-5 (216 individuals) and 6-10 (325 individuals). The first group can be considered as novices concerning the topic of research data management, whereas several levels of expertise are represented in the second group.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(classInt)
source("plot_jenks.R")
jenks_erfahrung <- plotJenks(d_fr2$erfahrung_fdm, n = 2)
```

The IANUS survey asked a similar question in 2013 with the following results: Very much experience: 31x - 13%; a lot of experience: 90x - 37%; rather a lot of experience: 76x - 31%; rather little experience: 33 - 14%, little experience: 7x - 3%, very little experience: 5x - 2% [@heinrich_digitale_2014, 9]. Their group of “novices” (having very little to rather little experience) is smaller compared with the NFDI4Objects survey. In 2013 about 20% of respondents can be categorised as novices; in the present study almost 40% of respondents assess their own skills as belonging to the “lower half” (5 or smaller, for details see the [table](#experience-table)).

This again demonstrates how the above mentioned digital transformation resulted in a broader lay-audience being interested in this topic, which is now reflected in this survey.

### Correlation of measures of importance and experience

In order to visualize a possible correlation between the measures of experience and the assessment of the importance of digital research data management for respondent’s own work, the two measures are plotted against each other and a linear regression calculated. As both measures are not normally distributed, this only serves as illustration. Kendall’s Tau is calculated below to demonstrate the correlation. The colour of the dots indicates each individual’s categorisation in terms of their professional role.

```{r fig_gruppe_data}

erfahrung_group <- age_erfahrung %>%
  gather(key = "gruppe", value = "ja.nein", 6:14, na.rm = TRUE) %>%
  filter(ja.nein == "Ja" )

```

```


```{r}
tau <- cor.test(d_fr$erfahrung_fdm, d_fr$stellenwert_fdm, method = "kendall", alternative = "two.sided")
```

The two assessment variables correlate moderately (Kendall’s Tau = `r round(tau$estimate,2) ` and p ≈ $ 3.2^{-41} $), showing that most people assigning high values to the importance of research data management already have some knowledge about it. 

For NFDI4Objects, individuals that have little experience with research data management (experience levels of 0-5) but a high regard for it (importance levels of 6-10) are of special importance: They are the target audience in need of training activities related to research data management. They already are aware that they need further training and probably only lack options to receive such training. In this target audience all groups are represented except the group of Data and IT representatives (clearly showing their expertise in comparison to all other groups).

### Importance of research data management for different scientific disciplines

Looking at various disciplines and their assessment of the importance of digital research data management in their work may give an indication as to which disciplines are already familiar with digital research data management strategies.

```{r stellenwert_label_placement}
cts <- merge(aggregate(stellenwert_fdm ~ disz_grob, d_fr2, length), 
               aggregate(stellenwert_fdm ~ disz_grob, d_fr2, median), 
               by=c("disz_grob"))
# Rename the col names to fit with the original dataset..
names(cts) <- c("disz_grob", "count", "median")
```


```{r stellenwert_fdm_disziplin_grob,  fig.width=10, fig.height=8}

library(ggplot2)
library(viridis)
  ggplot(data = d_fr2, aes(x = disz_grob,
               y = stellenwert_fdm))+
  geom_boxplot()+
      geom_jitter(position=position_jitter(width=.3, height=0), aes(colour = stellenwert_fdm))+
    geom_text(data = cts, aes(x = disz_grob, 
                              y= 11,
                              label= paste("n =", count)), 
            position=position_dodge(width=1.0))+
  theme_bw()+
    scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Archäologie" = "Archaeology",
                         "keine Angabe" = "no answer",
                         "MINT" = "MINT subjects",
                         "Musikwissenschaft" = "Musicology",
                         "Kunst" =  "Art",
                         "Geschichte" = "History",
                         "Archäo-Wissenschaften" = "Archaeological Sciences",
                         "Denkmalpflege und Bauforschung" = "Heritage Management / \n Building Research",
                         "Restaurationswissenschaften" = "Conservation Science",
                         "IT" = "IT",
                         "Geistes-und Kulturwissenschaften" = "Humanities",
                         "sonstige" = "Other",
                         "Museologie" = "Museology",
                         "Numismatik" = "Numismatics",
                         "Altertumswissenschaften" = "Ancient Studies",
                         "Anthropologie" = "Anthropology",
                         "Digitales" = "Digital Humanities",
                         "Bibliothekswissenschaft" = "Library Studies",
                         "Provenienzforschung" = "Provenance Research"))+
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        title = element_text("assessment: importance of RDM for daily work"),
       legend.position="bottom",
         text = element_text(size = 12),
         axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12),
         axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12))+
  ylab("0: no experience, 10: a lot of experience") + 
  xlab ("Categorised disciplines")+
  scale_color_viridis(option = "D")+
  scale_colour_viridis(name = "assessment: importance of RDM for daily work    ")+
    coord_flip()
  
```

It can be deduced from this plot that there is some variance in the answers submitted. Though all disciplines show medians between 6 and 9, the spread and variation of answers differs. Especially in archaeology, which is the largest group, answers range from 0 to 10. Other disciplines may be less completely represented in the study, thereby biasing the results in favour of the high degree of importance accorded to research data management.

We nonetheless may conclude that the importance of digital research data management for the daily work of individuals is - all in all - high.


#### Experience in research data management for different scientific disciplines

```{r erfahrung_fdm_disziplin_grob, fig.width=10, fig.height=8}

cts2 <- merge(aggregate(erfahrung_fdm ~ disz_grob, d_fr2, length), 
               aggregate(erfahrung_fdm ~ disz_grob, d_fr2, median), 
               by=c("disz_grob"))
# Rename the col names to fit with the original dataset..
names(cts2) <- c("disz_grob", "count", "median")


library(ggplot2)
library(viridis)
  ggplot(data = d_fr2, aes(x = disz_grob,
               y = erfahrung_fdm))+
  geom_boxplot()+
      geom_jitter(position=position_jitter(width=.3, height=0), aes(colour = erfahrung_fdm))+
            geom_text(data = cts2, aes(x = disz_grob, 
                              y= 11,
                              label= paste("n =", count)), 
            position=position_dodge(width=1.0))+
  theme_bw()+
    scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Archäologie" = "Archaeology",
                         "keine Angabe" = "no answer",
                         "MINT" = "MINT subjects",
                         "Musikwissenschaft" = "Musicology",
                         "Kunst" =  "Art",
                         "Geschichte" = "History",
                         "Archäo-Wissenschaften" = "Archaeological Sciences",
                         "Denkmalpflege und Bauforschung" = "Heritage Management / \n Building Research",
                         "Restaurationswissenschaften" = "Conservation Science",
                         "IT" = "IT",
                         "Geistes-und Kulturwissenschaften" = "Humanities",
                         "sonstige" = "Other",
                         "Museologie" = "Museology",
                         "Numismatik" = "Numismatics",
                         "Altertumswissenschaften" = "Ancient Studies",
                         "Anthropologie" = "Anthropology",
                         "Digitales" = "Digital Humanities",
                         "Bibliothekswissenschaft" = "Library Studies",
                         "Provenienzforschung" = "Provenance Research"))+
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        title = element_text("Self-assessment: experience in RDM"),
        legend.position="bottom",
        text = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12))+
  ylab("0: no experience, 10: a lot of experience") + 
  xlab ("Categorised disciplines")+
  scale_color_viridis(option = "D")+
  scale_colour_viridis(name = "Self-assessment: experience in RDM")+
    coord_flip()
  
```

Self-assessment of experience in digital research data management also varies between the disciplines. It is obvious that the values are all in all lower than the levels of importance accorded to research data management for the respondents’ daily work. 


### Concerning experience: What kind of employer already offers research data management guidelines?


```{r tab_einrichtungen_richtlinien}

d_x <- d_fr

d_x$einrichtung[d_x$einrichtung == "Forschungsverbund"] <- "Außeruniversitäre Forschungseinrichtung"
d_x$einrichtung[d_x$einrichtung == "keiner"] <- "Sonstiges"

dt <- table(d_x$einrichtung, d_x$arbeitgeber_richtlinienkatalog)

dt_df <- as.data.frame.matrix(dt) 
dt_df$Employer <- c(rownames(dt))
colnames(dt_df) <- c("yes", "no", "don't know", "Employer")

dt_df[,c(4,1,2,3)] %>%
  mutate(Employer = recode(Employer,
   "Universität/Hochschule" = "University/College",
   "Sonstiges" =  "Other",
   "Museum" = "Museum",
   "Grabungsfirma" = "Commercial Archaeology",
   "keiner" = "no answer",
   "Denkmalbehörde" = "Heritage Management",
   "Außeruniversitäre Forschungseinrichtung" =  "Research institution",
   "Archiv" = "Archive")) %>%
  pander(caption = "Respondents' answers about RDM guidelines of their employing institution")

```

For this question, participants were asked whether their employer already had guidelines for research data management. As the possibility to answer “I do not know” was given, we believe the answers are informed ones. Commercial archaeology almost always has rules for research data management, as do archives. As these are “closest” to the production and archiving of data, this is not surprising. Heritage management, as it sets the rules for the data management of commercial archaeology, should have guidelines for research data management more often than is indicated here. All in all, more employers of one kind seem to have guidelines than not. Notable exceptions are museums and the “Other” category.


# Analysis of used services and data format for research data{#RDM_now}

## Analysing software used for data analysis

```{r}
fdm_dienste <- d_fr$software_fd_analyse

fdm_dienste <- fdm_dienste[!is.na(fdm_dienste)]

fdm_dienste_df <- as.data.frame(fdm_dienste)


library(tidyr)

fdm_dienste_df <- fdm_dienste_df %>%
  separate(fdm_dienste, c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H"), ", ") %>%
  gather( key = "egal", value = "fdm-dienst", c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H"), na.rm = TRUE)

fdm_d <- fdm_dienste_df$`fdm-dienst`

library("tm")
library("SnowballC")


docs <- Corpus(VectorSource(fdm_d))

#inspect(docs)

# alles kleinschreiben
docs <- tm_map(docs, content_transformer(tolower))

toexcel <- content_transformer(function (x , pattern ) gsub(pattern, "excel", x))

docs <- tm_map(docs, toexcel, "exel")


# Remove punctuations
docs <- tm_map(docs, removePunctuation)
# Eliminate extra white spaces
docs <- tm_map(docs, stripWhitespace)

#remove words
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeWords, c("ich", "die", "der", "das", "für", "analysen", "daten","nicht", "fragen", "und", "mit", "was", "ist", "des", "frage")) 

dtm <- TermDocumentMatrix(docs)
m <- as.matrix(dtm)
v <- sort(rowSums(m),decreasing=TRUE)
d_docs <- data.frame(word = names(v),freq=v)
#head(d_docs, 30)
```

For this question, users were asked to indicate up to seven different software or online services they use for data processing tasks. A text mining analysis, counting which programmes were named how often, gives insights about the frequency of use.

```{r dienste_häufigkeiten, fig.width=10, fig.height=8}

d_docs %>%
  filter(freq > 2) %>%
ggplot()+
  geom_col(aes(x = reorder(word, freq),
                              y = freq,
               fill = factor(ifelse(word == "eigene" | word == "keine","Highlighted","Normal"))),
             show.legend = FALSE)+
  scale_fill_manual(values = n4o_farben[c(2,1)])+
    theme_bw()+
   theme(text = element_text(size = 12),
         axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12),
         axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12))+
  xlab("Software")+
  ylab("Frequency (filtered for n >/= 2x)")+
  geom_label(aes(x = 5, 
                 y = 150,
                 label = "text mining - analysis of the question \n 'With which services do you analyse your data for scientific work?' "))+
  coord_flip()
```

It is apparent that software most often used are Excel and QGIS, whereas Access is the best-known database system. This means that even though most people rely on Microsoft, they are willing to use open source and free software if it appears useful.

Highlighted are the words “keine” (“none”) and “eigene” (“own”). The former shows the number of people declaring they do not use any software for data analysis, whereas the second means that some institutions invest time and money to develop their own software or online service solutions. Further analysis could show that these are mostly Scientific Research Institutions (4x) and Heritage Management Departments (4x).
 


## Data formats

The question of which data formats are used by the respondents was analysed with a text mining approach, counting frequencies of mentions.

```{r}
# in auswahl genannte 
library(tidyr)

dataformats <- d_fr %>%
  gather(key = "datenformat", value = "datjanein", c(27:39), na.rm = TRUE)

dataformats <- subset(dataformats, dataformats$datjanein == "Ja")

```


```{r}
# sonstige genannte 

dat2 <- as.data.frame(d_fr$`dateiformat_sonstige`)
colnames(dat2) <- "d"

dat2 <- subset(dat2, !is.na(d))

dat2_docs <- Corpus(VectorSource(dat2))

inspect(dat2_docs)

toSpace <- content_transformer(function (x , pattern ) gsub(pattern, " ", x))
dat2_docs <- tm_map(dat2_docs, toSpace, "/")
dat2_docs <- tm_map(dat2_docs, toSpace, "@")
dat2_docs <- tm_map(dat2_docs, toSpace, "\\|")



# Convert the text to lower case
dat2_docs <- tm_map(dat2_docs, content_transformer(tolower))

# Remove german common stopwords
dat2_docs <- tm_map(dat2_docs, removeWords, stopwords("german"))

dat2_docs <- tm_map(dat2_docs, removeWords, c("diverse", "weitere", "etc", "proprietäre", "interne", "analysenformate", "formate"))


#geopackage to gpkg
#markdown to md
#photoshop to psd
#ppt, pptx 
#"weietre"           "weitere" 
#usw
# interne
#rmd # rscript
# check was das prob mit ttlrdfgeojsonld ist
# diverse, weitere, etc, ... ?
#- format
# datenbanken irgendwie zusammenfassen?: "datenbankeinträge" "datenbanken"   

# Remove punctuations
dat2_docs <- tm_map(dat2_docs, removePunctuation)
# Eliminate extra white spaces
dat2_docs <- tm_map(dat2_docs, stripWhitespace)

# Document matrix is a table containing the frequency of the words. 
# Column names are words and row names are documents. 
# The function TermDocumentMatrix() from text mining package can be used as follow :
dtm <- TermDocumentMatrix(dat2_docs)
m <- as.matrix(dtm)
v <- sort(rowSums(m),decreasing=TRUE)
d <- data.frame(word = names(v),freq=v)
head(d, 30)
```

```{r häufigkeiten_datenformate, fig.height=4}
dat <- as.data.frame(table(dataformats$datenformat))

colnames(dat) <- c("word", "freq")

dat3 <- rbind(dat, d)

dat3 %>%
  filter(freq > 2) %>%
ggplot()+
  geom_col(aes(x = reorder(word, freq),
               y = freq),
           fill = n4o_farben[1] )+
  theme_bw()+
  xlab("")+
  ylab("Frequency (several mentions possible, shown here n >/= 2)")+
  coord_flip()

ggsave("../figures/dataformats2.png", dpi = 300)

```

The four most frequently used data formats are pdf, doc, jpg and xls. These are quite generic and used in a lot of different settings. The frequent mentioning of geotiff, shape files and geojson demonstrates the need for quite specialised data formats in geospatial analyses. All in all, `r nrow(dat3)` different data formats were mentioned, some of them highly specialised for specific hardware, such as laser scanners or similar.


## Data storage

For the question regarding how data is stored during a project, users had the option of choosing several predefined answers.

```{r datastorage, fig.height=8, fig.width=10}

library(tidyr)
datastorage <- d_fr %>%
  gather( key = "datastorage", value = "jn", c("software_fd_analyse", "externes_datenzentrum", "privatwirtsch_cloud", "versionierung", "nicht_oeff_cloud", "zentralnetz_arbeitgeber", "institut_repo_arbeigeber", "repo_fachcomm", "lokal_dienstrechner", "lokal_privatrechner", "ext_festplatte", "usb", "cds_dvds"), na.rm = TRUE)%>%
  filter(jn == "Ja")

ds <- as.data.frame(table(datastorage$datastorage))

ggplot(data = ds)+
  geom_col(aes (x = reorder(Var1, Freq), 
                y=  Freq),
           fill = n4o_farben[1])+
  coord_flip() +
  theme_bw() + 
  xlab("Kind of data storage") +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = levels(ds$Var1),
       labels = c("CD/DVD", "External hard drive", "External data centre", "Institutional repositorium \n of employer", "Localer work PC", "Local privat PC", "Non-public \n Cloud-Service", "Private sector \n Cloud-Service", "Repositorium of \n specialist community", "USB", "Versioning system", "Central network of the employer"))+
  ylab("Frequency of mentions (multiple answers possible)")+
   theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),
         axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12)) 

```

The storage methods most frequently mentioned during the project phase are the central network of the employer, the external hard drive and local PCs. In comparison to the IANUS survey of 2013 [@heinrich_digitale_2014, 10] the answer “local work PC” has been surpassed by “central network of employer”, thereby showing the sensitization of employers and institutions regarding the topic of data archiving. Local hardware, such as external hard drives, USB sticks and local PCs, remains very important (for details see [tables](#storage-table)). 


```{r}
#sonstige

ds_sonst <- d_fr$datensicherung_sonstiges
ds_sonst <- ds_sonst[!is.na(ds_sonst)]

```
Named as "other" were mostly privat server solutions.

```{r}
#write.csv2(d_fr$sicherung_nach_projekt, "E:/R/N4Oumfrage/analysis/data/derived_data/nach_projektende.csv", fileEncoding = "UTF-8")
# händische Katalogisierung
```

## Comparison of data storage methods during the project and after the project

Respondents were asked to name the data storage facilities after a project ends in a free text field. In a second step, the type of data-storage facility was categorized into the groups mentioned beforehand in the question if possible; where this was not possible, new categories were created (for details, see [tables](#storage_after_project)).

```{r}
library(dplyr)

sicherung <- read.table("../data/derived_data/nach_projektende2.csv", 
                        sep = ",", 
                        header = TRUE, 
                        encoding = "UTF-8")

sicherung2<- sicherung %>%
  separate(sicherung_kat, c("A","B","C","D", "E", "F"), "," )  %>%

First of all, it is apparent that respondents mention more data storage systems if asked about their saving mechanisms during the project than if asked after the project ends. This may be due to the way the question was asked (free text in comparison to check boxes); it may also be due to respondents not considering long-term storage of project data as much their responsibility as e.g. the responsibility of just the PI or their employer.

In comparison to the IANUS survey [@heinrich_digitale_2014, 10], we see a lower percentage of answers concerning storage after the project end. The local work or private PC is used for storage even less often after the project ends than in the 2013 IANUS survey. Only a few people use professional archives (repository of specialist community, external data centres or the institutional repository of the employer), similarly to 2013. Local networks or servers provided by the employer are used most often, which shows their rising importance.

# Analysis of wishes mentioned{#wishes}

The analysis of the wishes mentioned by survey participants began with a classification approach, in which the free text answers were classified according to re-occurring topics.

The respondents would like to have available standards and are in need of support and guidelines to apply these standards in their own work. Forty-four participants explained that the solutions offered will have to be easy to use, otherwise they will not be adopted. Many respondents would like to see long-term archiving and accessibility of these archived data (searchable, open data). Data portals with access and rights management would be the approach to adopt. Financing, on the one hand, to enable staff to create their own data with metadata and standards in accordance with guidelines and, on the other hand, to ensure long-term archiving were re-occurring topics that will need to be addressed. Linking of data and networking between platforms and individuals is a recurring wish, as are measures to create awareness for all the topics mentioned. A complete overview of the topics mentioned can be consulted in the [tables](#wish-list).



# Conclusions

Due to the representative number of answers, some conclusions can be drawn for the consortium:

 1.	NFDI4Objects will need to gain more insight into the thoughts of students and PhD-students. TA6, with its high number of participants in the category of university professors, will be able to respond to this need.

 2.	Though younger people could be shown to have lower levels of experience in digital research data management, these are not only students: In all status groups, respondents are in need of training. Workshops need to be developed not just for students but also for principal investigators, heads of department, lecturers, scientific and technical employees.

 3.	Within the group surveyed, two different experience groups could be shown: those assessing their knowledge level between the values of 0 and 5 (216 individuals) and those setting it between 6 and 10 (325 individuals). These differing levels of expertise will find different roles in the NFDI4Objects consortium. The first group will be the target group for training and workshops and the second group will be engaged via expert groups and advisory roles.

 4.	NFDI4Objects will be able to develop training curricula for research data management especially for those disciplines that have the lowest levels of knowledge and experience (Library Studies, several art-related subjects, Conservation Science, Anthropology, to name just a few).

 5.	Analysing which kind of institutions already offer research data management guidelines enables NFDI4Objects to support especially those groups that do not yet have experience with developing such guidelines. Here, TA2 with its focus on collection research will be very helpful for museums.

 6.	The high variability of data types (sixty-seven different data types were mentioned) within the answers to this survey exemplifies the diversity of the fields associated with exploring the material remains of the human past. 

 7.	The importance of employers’ data storage facilities has risen over the years. NFDI4Objects will be able to encourage these institutions not just to store data but to enable linking and opening of repositories.

 8.	The “wish list” of survey participants is being taken into consideration in the context of development of systems and services by NFDI4Objects.
